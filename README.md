## Features

- **High-Performance:** The website is developed with performance in mind. It uses TailwindCSS, which is a utility-first framework with dead code elimination, reducing bloated CSS files. Additionally, it also uses lightweight javascript libraries in providing complex design implementations through GSAP and Three without sacrificing performance.

- **Powerful Animations by GSAP:** The website provides enhanced user experience through smooth and beautiful animations using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). GSAP is a light-weight Javascript library used for high-performance animations.

- **3D Model Rendering with Three.js:** The website uses React-Three-Fiber (R3F) in rendering 3D Models for React. Users can explore the iPhone 15 Pro from every angle, color, and size using Three.js dynamic 3D rendering. Three.js is a Javascript library used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL. You can check their website by clicking this link.
