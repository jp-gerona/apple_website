# Summary

This project is a clone of Apple's [iPhone 15 Pro](https://www.apple.com/ph/iphone-15-pro/) landing page, built using React.js and TailwindCSS framework. The website powered by [GSAP](https://gsap.com) and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) to provide users a seamless experience and a beautiful interface that will captivate users buying an iPhone 15 Pro.

## Features

- **High-Performance:** The website is developed with performance in mind. It uses TailwindCSS, which is a utility-first framework with dead code elimination, reducing bloated CSS files. Additionally, it also uses lightweight javascript libraries in providing complex design implementations through GSAP and Three without sacrificing performance.

- **Powerful Animations by GSAP:** The website provides enhanced user experience through smooth and beautiful animations using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). GSAP is a light-weight Javascript library used for high-performance animations.

- **3D Model Rendering with Three.js:** The website uses React-Three-Fiber (R3F) in rendering 3D Models for React. Users can explore the iPhone 15 Pro from every angle, color, and size using Three.js dynamic 3D rendering. Three.js is a Javascript library used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL. You can check their website by clicking this link.

- **Video Carousel:** The website provides users an engaging and unique interactive video carousel made possible with GSAP and React.

- **Responsiver User Design:** The website is responsive to large, medium, and small devices. Providing optimal and consistent viewing across different screen sizes.

## Running the Application

## Additional Notes

As stated with the note above, this project serves as a learning experience for me to understand and utilize the concepts of working with React and other front-end technologies. I will not use this project for **any reason** other than educational purposes only.

During this experience, I would say that using React opened a whole new world. To be more specific, it was really different from using plain/static HTML, CSS, and Javascript that I am used to. It felt like I was learning Web Development all over again.

However, I learned a lot from this 1-week project during my term break. I definitely think that building real-life projects is the best way to learn, and (hopefully) I can apply the knowledge that I have learned to my personal projects.

Special thanks to [Javascript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery) for this well-explained and awesome tutorial :)
